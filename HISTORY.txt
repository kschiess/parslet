= 2.0 / ?? (future release changes, like a reminder to self)
  
  - prsnt? and absnt? are now finally banned into oblivion. Wasting vocals for
    the win. 
    
= 1.3.0 / ???

  + Transform#apply can now be called with a hash as second argument. This 
    provides bindings and a way to inject context.
    
= 1.2.1 / 6Jun2011

  ! FIX: Input at the end of a parse raises Parslet::UnconsumedInput. (see
    issue 18)

  ! FIX: Unicode parsing should now work as expected. (see issue 38)
  
  ! FIX: Slice#slice returned wrong bits at times (see issue 36).

= 1.2.0 / 4Feb2011
  
  + Parslet::Parser is now also a grammar atom, it can be composed freely with
    other atoms. (str('f') >> MiniLispParser.new >> str('b'))
    
  + No strings, only slices are returned as part of the parser result. 
    Parslet::Slice is almost a string class, but one that remembers the 
    source offset. This has also bought us a slight speedup.
    
  + require 'parslet/convenience' now brings #parse_with_debug to all parslets.
    This is a consequence of the above change. 
  
  + Deprecates prsnt? and absnt? in favor of the more readable absent? and
    prsnt?. Uses 3 bytes more RAM. The old variants will exist until we release
    2.0. 
  
  INTERNALLY
  
  + Visitors now should have methods that all begin with 'visit_*'. #str 
    becomes #visit_str.

  + Parslet::Atoms::Entity now takes only a block argument instead of context
    and block. 

= 1.1.1 / 4Feb2011

  ! FIX: Line counting was broken by performance optimisations. 
  
  + Squeezed out another few drops of performance. 

= 1.1.0 / 2Feb2011
  
  + Uses return (fail/success), cached line counts, memoizing of parse results 
    and other tricks internally for at least an order of magnitude increase 
    in execution speed.
    
  + str('foo').maybe will now return an empty string again. Use .as(...) to 
    name things and get back [] from #repeat and nil from #maybe.
    
  + If you require 'parslet/atoms/visitor', you'll get an accept method on
    all known Parslet::Atoms.
    
  + If you require 'parslet/export', you can call #to_citrus and #to_treetop
    to produce string versions of your grammar in those dialects.
  
  + Requiring 'parslet/convenience' will given you a parse_with_debug on 
    your Parslet::Parser class. This prints some diagnostics on parse failure. 
    (Thanks to Florian Hanke)
        
= 1.0.1 / 17Jan2011

  A happy new year!
  
  ! FIX: Parslet::Transform was wrongly fixed earlier - it now wont mangle 
    hashes anymore. (Blake Sweeney)
    
  + parslet/rig/rspec.rb contains useful rspec matchers. (R. Konstantin Haase)

= 1.0.0 / 29Dez2010

  - #each_match was removed. There was some duplication of code that even 
    confused me - and we should not have 2 methods of achieving the same
    goal. 
    
  + Full documentation. Fixed sdoc. 

= 0.11.0 / 25Nov2010

  ! Bugfixes to tree handling. Let's hope that was the last such significant
    change to the core.

= 0.10.1 / 22Nov2010

  + Allow match['a-z'], shortcut for match('[a-z]')

  ! Fixed output inconsistencies (behaviour in connection to 'maybe')

= 0.10.0 / 22Nov2010

  + Parslet::Transform now takes a block on initialisation, wherein you can
    define all the rules directly.
    
  + Parslet::Transform now only passes a hash to the block during transform
    when its arity is 1. Otherwise all hash contents as bound as local     
    variables.
    
  + Both inline and other documentation have been improved. 
  
  + You can now use 'subtree(:x)' to bind any subtree to x during tree pattern
    matching. 
    
  + Transform classes can now include rules into class definition. This makes
    Parser and Transformer behave the same. 
  
= 0.9.0 / 28Oct2010
  * More of everything: Examples, documentation, etc...

  * Breaking change: Ruby's binary or ('|') is now used for alternatives, 
    instead of the division sign ('/') - this reduces the amount of 
    parenthesis needed for a grammar overall. 

  * parslet.maybe now yields the result or nil in case of parse failure. This
    is probably better than the array it did before; the jury is still out on
    that. 
    
  * parslet.repeat(min, max) is now valid syntax

= 0.1.0 / not released.

  * Initial version. Classes for parsing, matching in the resulting trees
    and transforming the trees into something more useful.  
    
  * Parses and outputs intermediary trees
    
  * Matching of single elements and sequences
