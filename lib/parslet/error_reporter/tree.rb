module Parslet
  module ErrorReporter
    # An error reporter has two central methods, one for reporting errors at
    # the current parse position (#err) and one for reporting errors at a
    # given parse position (#err_at). The reporter can return an object (a
    # 'cause') that will be returned to the caller along with the information
    # that the parse failed.
    #
    # When reporting errors on the outer levels of your parser, these methods
    # get passed a list of error objects ('causes') from the inner levels. In
    # this default implementation, the inner levels are considered error
    # subtrees and are appended to the generated tree node at each level,
    # thereby constructing an error tree.
    #
    # This error tree will report in parallel with the grammar structure that
    # failed. A one-to-one correspondence exists between each error in the
    # tree and the parslet atom that produced that error.
    #
    # The implementor is really free to use these return values as he sees
    # fit. One example would be to return an error state object from these
    # methods that is then updated as errors cascade up the parse derivation
    # tree.
    #

      # with the errors that happened at a level below (children).
