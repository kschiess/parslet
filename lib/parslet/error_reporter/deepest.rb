    # Instead of reporting the latest error that happens like {Tree} does,
    # this class reports the deepest error. Depth is defined here as how
    # advanced into the input an error happens. The errors close to the
    # greatest depth tend to be more relevant to the end user, since they
    # specify what could be done to make them go away.
    #
    # More specifically, errors produced by this reporter won't be related to
    # the structure of the grammar at all. The positions of the errors will
    # be advanced and convey at every grammar level what the deepest rule
    # was to fail.
