# Matches trees against expressions. Trees are formed by arrays and hashes
# for expressing membership and sequence. The leafs of the tree are other
# classes. 
#
# A tree issued by the parslet library might look like this: 
#
#   { 
#     :function_call => {
#       :name => 'foobar', 
#       :args => [1, 2, 3]
#     }
#   }
#
# A pattern that would match against this tree would be: 
#
#   { :function_call => { :name => simple(:name), :args => sequence(:args) }}
#
# Note that Parslet::Pattern only matches at a given subtree; it wont try 
# to match recursively. To do that, please use Parslet::Transform.
