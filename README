INTRODUCTION

Parslet makes developing complex parsers easy. It does so by

* providing the best <b>error reporting</b> possible
* <b>not generating</b> reams of code for you to debug

Parslet takes the long way around to make <b>your job</b> easier. It allows for
incremental language construction. Often, you start out small, implementing
the atoms of your language first; _parslet_ takes pride in making this
possible.

SYNOPSIS

  require 'parslet'
  include Parslet

  # Constructs a parser using a Parser Expression Grammar like DSL: 
  parser =  str('"') >> 
            (
              str('\\') >> any |
              str('"').absnt? >> any
            ).repeat.as(:string) >> 
            str('"')
  
  # Parse the string and capture parts of the interpretation (:string above)        
  tree = parser.parse('"This is a \\"String\\" in which you can escape stuff"')

  tree # => {:string=>"This is a \\\"String\\\" in which you can escape stuff"}

  # Here's how you can grab results from that tree:

  transform = Parslet::Transform.new do
    rule(:string => simple(:x)) { 
      puts "String contents: #{x}" }
  end
  transform.apply(tree)

COMPATIBILITY

This library should work with most rubies. I've tested it with MRI 1.8 
(except 1.8.6), 1.9, rbx-head, jruby. Please report as a bug if you encounter 
issues.

STATUS 

At version 1.1 - Good basic functionality and lots of plans for extension.
