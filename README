INTRODUCTION

A small library that implements a PEG grammar. PEG means Parsing Expression
Grammars [1]. These are a different kind of grammars that recognize almost the
same languages as your conventional LR parser, except that they are easier to
work with, since they haven't been conceived for generation, but for
recognition of languages. You can read the founding paper of the field by
Bryan Ford here [2].

Other Ruby projects that work on the same topic are: 
http://wiki.github.com/luikore/rsec/
http://github.com/nathansobo/treetop

My goal here is to see how a parser/parser generator should be constructed to
allow clean AST construction and good error handling. It seems to me that most
often, parser generators only handle the success-case and forget about
debugging and error generation.

More specifically, this library is motivated by the project rooc[3], a
compiler I am writing. I started out using 'treetop' (see the link above), but
found it unusable. It was lacking in

  * error reporting: Hard to see where a grammar fails. 
  
  * stability of generated trees: Intermediary trees were dictated by the 
    grammar. It was hard to define invariants in that system - what was 
    convenient when writing the grammar often wasn't in subsequent stages. 
    
  * clarity of parser code: The parser code is generated and is very hard
    to read. Add that to the first point to understand my pain. 
    
So parslet tries to be different. It doesn't generate the parser, but instead
defines it in a DSL which is very close to what you find in [2]. A successful
parse then generates a parser tree consisting entirely of hashes and arrays
and strings (read: instable). This parser tree can then be converted to a real
AST (read: stable) using a pattern matcher that is also part of this library.

Error reporting is still lacking in many parts. I will be working on that part
as a user of the library while constructing rooc. [3]

SYNOPSIS

  require 'parslet'
  include Parslet

  # Constructs a parser using a Parser Expression Grammar like DSL: 
  parser =  str('"') >> 
            (
              (str('\\') >> any) /
              (str('"').absnt? >> any)
            ).repeat.as(:string) >> 
            str('"')
    
  # Parse the string and capture parts of the interpretation (:string above)        
  tree = parser.parse(%Q{
    "This is a \\"String\\" in which you can escape stuff"
  }.strip)

  tree # => {:string=>"This is a \\\"String\\\" in which you can escape stuff"}

  # Here's how you can grab results from that tree: 
  Pattern.new(:string => simple(:x)).each_match(tree) do |dictionary|
    puts "String contents: #{dictionary[:x]}"
  end
  
  # Here's how to transform that tree into something else --------------------

  # Defines the classes of our new Syntax Tree
  class StringLiteral < Struct.new(:text); end

  # Defines a set of transformation rules on tree leafes
  transform = Transform.new
  transform.rule(:string => simple(:x)) { |d| StringLiteral.new(d[:x]) }

  # Transforms the tree
  transform.apply(tree) 

  # => #<struct StringLiteral text="This is a \\\"String\\\" ... escape stuff">
  
COMPATIBILITY

This library should work with both ruby 1.8 and ruby 1.9.

STATUS 

Preparing for first release. Not many edge cases left to be covered, but error
reporting is still lacking. Usable for most compiler projects.
