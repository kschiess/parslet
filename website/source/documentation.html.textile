"*Getting Started*":get-started.html

Are you brand new to parslet? Well then let's introduce you guys. This is what
you should read and try out first. 

There's also a "video version":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F-eh66zw90!

"*Examples*":https://github.com/kschiess/parslet/tree/master/example/

Parslet comes with a lot of examples that explain how to use various aspects. 
Take a look at those. 

"*In depth*":overview.html

This is the real technical documentation, showing you how to use all aspects
of parslet. Especially: 

* "Overview":overview.html explains parslet's goals and gives you a bigger
  picture.
* Using "Parslet::Parser":parser.html to *write parsers*.
* Using "Parslet::Transform":transform.html to *turn your intermediary
  trees into something useful*.
* "Tricks":tricks.html for common situations.

*Projects*

There is a "Projects page":projects.html with everything from JSON through Java
to Ruby parsed with parslet.

*Presentations*

* "Parslet, An Introduction":https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0AfXgUAUtzyc7ZGZrcG1mNXNfMzIwZ3JjY2c3NW0

*Videos*

*Blogs*

* "Parslet Intro":http://florianhanke.com/blog/2011/02/01/parslet-intro.html
  explains quite a few things on how parsers work and on parser
  metaprogramming. Besides, Florian Hanke also explains how to create an ERB
  parser in just a few lines!
  
* "Parslet and
  JSON":http://jmettraux.wordpress.com/2011/05/11/parslet-and-json/ shows how
  to construct a JSON parser in a few lines.
  "John":http://jmettraux.wordpress.com/about/ does a great job of explaining
  how parslet ties back in with railroad diagrams.

* "Parsing TOML in Ruby with Parslet":http://zerowidth.com/2013/02/24/parsing-toml-in-ruby-with-parslet.html
  shows how to parse TOML ("Tom's Obvious Minimal Language":https://github.com/mojombo/toml)
  using parslet. I sense a theme here. Code is on github - this is the first
  article in a series, linked from the article.

* "Write You a Parser for Fun and Win":http://viget.com/extend/write-you-a-parser-for-fun-and-win
  a succinct writeup on parsing text formats by David Eisinger.
 
"*YARD Class Documentation*":http://rubydoc.info/gems/parslet/frames

The "YARD documentation":http://rubydoc.info/gems/parslet/frames will help you
with the nitty gritty. This documentation is real important too. It will be
constantly improved! (Thanks linode.com and DockYard for sponsoring this tool.)
