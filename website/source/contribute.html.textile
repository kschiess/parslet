h2. Bugs 

Log in to github and open a bug ticket
"here":https://github.com/kschiess/parslet/issues. Please be sure to include
the version of parslet and Ruby; maybe you can even provide some code that
exhibits the bug?

And of course if you provide a properly tested patch, you'll be our hero and 
get a place in the space below for lifetime.

Have you got a project that uses parslet? Please write
"us":mailto:kaspar.schiess@absurd.li about it.

an hour.

"*wt* aka working title":https://github.com/kschiess/wt

h2. Thanks for all the fish -- Contributions

* *Zach Moazeni* ("zmoazeni":https://github.com/zmoazeni) for his work on
  Unicode performance.

* *rogerbraun* ("rogerbraun":https://github.com/rogerbraun) for being my
  unicode tester. 

* *meh* ("meh":http://meh.paranoid.pk/) for taking a real close look. 

* *John Mettraux* ("jmettraux":http://jmettraux.wordpress.com/) for the really
  nice JSON example and for pushing parslet beyond its limits.

* *Josep M. Bach* ("txus":http://www.txustice.me/) for minding the small 
  things that make a big difference.

* *Matthew Draper* ("matthewd":http://matthewd.net/) for bothering with my 
  broken CSS.

* *Hal Brodigan* ("postmodern":http://postmodern.github.com/) for solving our
  email parsing needs!

* *R. Konstantin Haase* ("rhk":http://rkh.im/) for rspec matchers that help
  stamp out, eliminate and abolish redundancy.

* *Florian Hanke* ("floere":http://floere.github.com) has given a lot of very
  inspiring input for parslet. His questions have been key to rounding off the
  corners and making the library as aesthetic as it is. And just look at the 
  logo. 
  
* *Kaspar Schiess* ("absurd.li":http://www.absurd.li) for being brave enough
  to actually add another parser library to a field that's already bursting
  at the seams.
